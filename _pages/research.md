   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  I show that prices impact analyst cash flow expectations and argue this impact can partially reconcile subjective beliefs data with asset pricing models in which investors have rational expectations and discount rate variation drives prices. Previous work argues that correlations of biased analyst cash flow expectations with prices and future returns contradict rational models and imply biased investor expectations distort prices. However, using two instrumental variables for price, I find increases in price unrelated to cash flow news raise analyst cash flow expectations. Based on this empirical finding, I propose a model with rational investors that matches key moments in beliefs data: analysts form biased cash flow expectations by learning from prices that contain discount rate variation. Thus, while stylized facts in beliefs data can be consistent with investors having biased expectations that distort prices, these facts can also be consistent with investors having rational expectations and analysts learning from prices.  </p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  I quantify the impact of belief distortions in investors' subjective cash flow growth expectations on asset prices. Given the lack of data on investor growth expectations, I propose a novel structural approach for recovering changes in investor expectations around analyst announcements by using structure on investor learning. I find a 1% increase in annual investor growth expectations raises asset prices contemporaneously by 60% to 90% less than in standard models. This small static impact implies prices incorporate changes in expectations gradually, which can occur if investors' asset demand responds slowly to changes in expectations. I show that in a quantitative model with slow-moving asset demand, this gradual incorporation significantly dampens how much belief distortions amplify return volatility.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  I quantify the causal impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on expected returns. The exogenous timing of macroeconomic announcements provides an instrument for uncertainty. Using realized returns and daily measures of macroeconomic uncertainty, I find announcements resolve uncertainty, which causes expected returns to fall. Under weak assumptions, macroeconomic uncertainty explains at most 32% of expected return variation. Under the additional, empirically justified assumption that other expected return drivers do not correlate with announcement timing, macroeconomic uncertainty explains 10% of expected return variation and a one standard deviation increase in macroeconomic uncertainty raises long-run expected returns by 173 basis points. </p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  We propose a novel reinforcement learning approach to extract high-frequency aggregate growth expectations from asset prices. While much expectations-based research in macroeconomics and finance relies on low-frequency surveys, the multitude of events that pass between survey dates renders identification of causal effects on expectations difficult. Our method allows us to construct a daily time-series of the cross-sectional mean of a panel of GDP growth forecasts. The high-frequency nature of our series enables clean identification in event studies. In particular, we use our estimated daily growth expectations series to test the “Fed information effect.” Extensions of our framework can obtain daily expectations series of any macroeconomic variable for which a low-frequency panel of forecasts is available. In this way, our method provides a sharp empirical tool to advance understanding of how expectations are formed. </p>
