   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  I show that prices impact analyst cash flow expectations and argue this impact can partially reconcile subjective beliefs data with asset pricing models in which investors have rational expectations and discount rate variation drives prices. Previous work argues that correlations of biased analyst cash flow expectations with prices and future returns contradict rational models and imply biased investor expectations distort prices. However, using two instrumental variables for price, I find increases in price unrelated to cash flow news raise analyst cash flow expectations. Based on this empirical finding, I propose a model with rational investors that matches key moments in beliefs data: analysts form biased cash flow expectations by learning from prices that contain discount rate variation. Thus, while stylized facts in beliefs data can be consistent with investors having biased expectations that distort prices, these facts can also be consistent with investors having rational expectations and analysts learning from prices.  </p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b> A growing literature estimates   price multipliers --- per-unit impacts of demand shocks on asset prices --- using plausibly exogenous but small shocks. However, it is theoretically ambiguous how these estimates extrapolate to the large shocks that are often of interest for policy and economic questions. This paper documents a new stylized fact: stock-level price multipliers decrease as the magnitude of demand shocks increases. We study three widely-used   demand shocks   unrelated to cash flow news, and find that multipliers are   smaller for both larger contemporaneous and larger cumulative   past shocks. Using investor holdings data, we also find   higher demand elasticities in securities with larger price dislocations.   Our findings shed light on  the microfoundations of inelastic demand. While these findings  cannot be explained by  several prominent mechanisms, they   are consistent with models in which investors endogenously allocate more attention and capital toward greater profit opportunities.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b> I find that stock prices incorporate subjective growth expectations gradually rather than immediately, and demonstrate that this gradual incorporation weakens the impact of biased expectations on prices. Previous work assumes <i>immediate</i> incorporation, so excessive fluctuations in growth expectations create excessive fluctuations in prices that amplify volatility. In contrast, using analyst forecasts as proxies for investor growth expectations, I provide reduced-form evidence of <i>gradual</i>  incorporation. I then develop a structural learning model to quantify the degree of gradual incorporation. The model recovers investor growth expectation changes, thereby avoiding measurement error from using analyst forecasts as proxies. I find that  only 10% to 30% of a given expectation change is immediately incorporated into price. Based on these findings, I propose and calibrate an asset pricing model in which gradual incorporation arises from slow-moving asset demand. The model shows that gradual incorporation weakens the impact of biased growth expectations on return volatility. Thus, the impact of biased growth expectations on prices is smaller than previous work suggests. </p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  I quantify the causal impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on expected returns. The exogenous timing of macroeconomic announcements provides an instrument for uncertainty. Using realized returns and daily measures of macroeconomic uncertainty, I find announcements resolve uncertainty, which causes expected returns to fall. Under weak assumptions, macroeconomic uncertainty explains at most 32% of expected return variation. Under the additional, empirically justified assumption that other expected return drivers do not correlate with announcement timing, macroeconomic uncertainty explains 10% of expected return variation and a one standard deviation increase in macroeconomic uncertainty raises long-run expected returns by 173 basis points. </p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px;margin-bottom: 5px;margin-top: 0;"> <b>Abstract:</b>  We propose a novel reinforcement learning approach to extract high-frequency aggregate growth expectations from asset prices. While much expectations-based research in macroeconomics and finance relies on low-frequency surveys, the multitude of events that pass between survey dates renders identification of causal effects on expectations difficult. Our method allows us to construct a daily time-series of the cross-sectional mean of a panel of GDP growth forecasts. The high-frequency nature of our series enables clean identification in event studies. In particular, we use our estimated daily growth expectations series to test the “Fed information effect.” Extensions of our framework can obtain daily expectations series of any macroeconomic variable for which a low-frequency panel of forecasts is available. In this way, our method provides a sharp empirical tool to advance understanding of how expectations are formed. </p>
